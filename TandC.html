                Be aware that if you utilize an automated means of accessing or downloading this web site, in whole or in part, your
                access to the site may be prevented, terminated, delayed, or slowed either temporarily or permanently, especially if you
                attempt to download too many large files simultaneously. This is necessary to protect the user-experience of the web
                site for those who access it in the manner envisioned by its authors.
                Please understand that automated access to the site, via scripts, bots, or other similar means can have the effect of
                seriously degrading the performance of the web site or incurring significant additional costs to its operators without
                sufficient revenue generated to cover those costs. Keep in mind, that even minor infractions against this policy can
                have a large negative effect when combined with similar actions by other users.
                We ask that you respect the above guidelines so that we may continue to offer the web site as a free resource to the
