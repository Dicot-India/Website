                    <h2>Non-Personal Information We May Collect</h2>

                    <p>
                        Dicot may also collect non-personal information, such as
                        your IP address or your browsing patterns, by
                        using cookies on its websites. The use of cookies is an
                        industry standard, and you’ll find most major websites

                        One way to prevent the use of cookies is to activate the
                        facility which is available in most web browsers that
                        enables the user to deny or accept cookies.

                    <h2>Use of Google Analytics</h2>
                    <br>

                    We use Google Analytics to collect information about the use
                    of the Website. Google Analytics collects
                    information such as how often users visit this site, what
                    pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they
                    used prior to coming to the Website. We use the information
                    we get from Google Analytics only to improve the Website.
                    Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to
                    you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name
                    or
                    other identifying information. We do not combine the
                    information collected through the use of Google Analytics
                    with your
                    Personal Data. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent
                    cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user
                    the next time you visit the Website, the cookie cannot be
                    used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share
                    information collected by Google Analytics about your visits
                    to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms
                    of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google
                    Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to the
                    Website by disabling cookies on your browser.
                    Google Analytics employs cookies to define user sessions,
                    which allows for the collection of data about how visitors
                    are using the Website. Google Analytics uses only
                    first-party cookies for data analysis. This means that the
                    cookies are linked to a specific website domain, and Google
                    Analytics will only use that cookie data for statistical
                    analysis related to your browsing behaviour on that specific
                    website. According to Google, the data collected
                    cannot be altered or retrieved by services from other
                    domains. If you choose, you can opt out by turning off
                    cookies in the preferences settings in your web browser.
